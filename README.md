# 🧬 bioinfo-skills

A practical learning hub where I build **bioinformatics** skills through small, hands-on projects.  
This repo collects my **coding practice**, **bioinformatics workflows**, **ML experiments**, and weekly **progress logs**.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen foundations in **Python**, **R**, **Bash/Linux**
- Practice **bioinformatics workflows**: **MSA**, **DADA2**, **DESeq2**, **phyloseq**
- Build reproducible workflows with **Snakemake**
- Apply **machine learning** (scikit-learn) to biological data
- Learn **HPC/AWS** basics for real research environments
- Keep everything **reproducible** and **well documented**

---

## 🗂️ Structure
| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `skills/` | Topic-based learning (Python, R, Bash, **Snakemake**, **MSA**, **ML**, HPC/AWS) |
| `projects/` | Applied mini-projects that combine multiple skills |
| `environment/` | Conda env files, HPC/AWS setup notes |
| `assets/` | Figures & templates shared across projects |
| `progress.md` | Ongoing learning log (weekly updates) |

---

## 🚀 Priority Skill Tracks
- **Snakemake** — reproducible, rule-based pipelines with per-rule conda envs  
- **MSA (Multi-Sequence Alignment)** — Clustal Omega, MAFFT, inspection & reporting  
- **Machine Learning (scikit-learn)** — clean pipelines, evaluation, bio use cases

---

## 🔬 Featured Mini-Projects
- [COVID-19 Genome Mutations](projects/covid19_genome_mutations/) — MSA + mutation notes
- [File Organiser CLI](projects/file_organiser_cli/) — small Python utility

---

## 📈 Progress
See [`progress.md`](progress.md) for weekly notes and next steps.
